/**
The GameLisp interpreter.

`Runtime` owns all of the data required to interpret GameLisp code: a set of global variables,
a symbol table, a set of registered Rust functions, and much more.

To manipulate a GameLisp runtime, you don't call methods on the `Runtime` type directly.
Instead, use the [`run` method](#method.run) to establish a particular `Runtime` as the
"active runtime", and then manipulate it using free functions like [`glsp::sym`](fn.sym.html)
and [`glsp::load`](fn.load.html).

If you attempt to execute any GameLisp-related code without an active runtime, it will
almost always panic.

It's possible for multiple `Runtimes` to coexist. Each runtime is strictly isolated from the 
others - they don't share global variables, symbols, and so on. This means that it's possible
to run GameLisp code in isolated `Runtimes` on multiple threads without requiring any 
synchronization.

Most GameLisp programs should create a single `Runtime` at the top of their `main()` function,
immediately call `Runtime::run()`, and keep the same runtime active for the entire duration
of the program.

```
use glsp::prelude::*;

fn main() {
	let runtime = Runtime::new();
	runtime.run(|| {
		glsp::load("main.glsp")?;

		//call the (main) function which was defined by main.glsp,
		//discarding its return value
		let main_gfn: Root<GFn> = glsp::global("main")?;
		let _: Val = glsp::call(&main_gfn, &())?;

		//the closure's return value must be a Result
		Ok(())
	});
}
```
*/

//a Runtime is just a thin wrapper for an Engine which has been initialized with the stdlib. we 
//separate Runtime from Engine so that procedural macros like backquote!(), which require a parser,
//can create an Engine while still being usable in the stdlib's implementation.
pub struct Runtime(Engine);

		//init_stdlib. we could potentially get this down to the sub-0.1ms range by caching the
		//initial syms and rfns databases globally so that they can be clone()d. (todo?)

		//an obstacle in the way of that plan: Sym and Rc<str> are both !Send. the only way
		//to store them globally would be thread_local!{}, which would eliminate any performance
		//savings when creating the first Runtime of a thread... which is the main use-case for
		//making Runtime::new() fast in the first place! postponing this for now.
